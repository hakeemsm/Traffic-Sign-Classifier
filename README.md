[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repo contains code and data for predicting [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) using Convolutional neural networks implemented using Tensorflow in a Jupyter notebook

Items included in this submission are: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report as a markdown writeup_template.md
* All the train, test and validation images 

The Project
---
The goals of this project were:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
